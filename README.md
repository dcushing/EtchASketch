# EtchASketch
A JavaScript/jQuery etch-a-sketch web app

Created based on a project from The Odin Project (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101). It's an etch-a-sketch written using JavaScript/jQuery. There are two modes: traditional black line mode and color randomizer mode. Additionally, the user can set the size of the grid squares.

Demo coming shortly.
